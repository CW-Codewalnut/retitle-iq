<TitleGenerationGuidelines>
  <CoreObjective>Generate blog titles that are simultaneously SEO-optimized for ranking *and* creatively compelling to maximize human engagement, curiosity, and click-through rates (CTR). The goal is not just functional accuracy, but insightful, attention-grabbing headlines.</CoreObjective>
  <CreativeGoal>Strive for titles with **creative flair, originality, and strong resonance** with the target audience's psychology and needs. Avoid predictability and generic phrasing. Aim for titles that feel **human-crafted, insightful, and uniquely valuable.**</CreativeGoal>
  <KeyPrinciples>
    <KeywordIntegration>
      <Constraint>Include the primary target keyword naturally within the title.</Constraint>
      <BestPractice>Place the keyword strategically (often near the beginning) where it flows best and maximizes relevance without feeling forced.</BestPractice>
      <Rule>Use the primary keyword only ONCE. Avoid keyword stuffing or awkward phrasing solely for keyword placement.</Rule>
    </KeywordIntegration>
    <LengthAndClarity>
      <Constraint>Keep titles concise: aim for approximately 50-60 characters (typically 6-10 words).</Constraint>
      <Reason>Ensures full visibility in SERPs and improves scannability.</Reason>
      <Rule>The title MUST clearly and accurately communicate the core topic and promise of the blog post.</Rule>
    </LengthAndClarity>
    <CompellingHooks>
      <Instruction>Strategically incorporate at least one hook element to **create genuine intrigue, highlight unique value, or evoke emotion**, ensuring it aligns perfectly with the content. Use hooks creatively, not just formulaically.</Instruction>
      <Types>
        <Hook name="Numbers">Use numerals (e.g., "7 Ways") for clear structure and expectation setting. Odd numbers often work well; consider if the number itself adds value (e.g., "The 3 Pillars of...").</Hook>
        <Hook name="PowerWords">Use persuasive/emotive words (e.g., "Proven," "Essential," "Surprising," "Effortless," "Secret") judiciously to add impact. Avoid overused clich√©s ("Ultimate," "Best," "Hack") unless used in a truly fresh or specific context.</Hook>
        <Hook name="EmotionalTriggers">Tap into curiosity, aspiration, urgency, FOMO, or address specific pain points/fears. Negative framing ("Mistakes," "Avoid," "Stop") can be powerful if the content provides clear solutions/value and the tone is appropriate.</Hook>
        <Hook name="Questions">Phrase titles as engaging questions that reflect user search intent, challenge assumptions, or pique deep curiosity (e.g., "Is X Silently Sabotaging Y?", "What If You Could...?"). Ensure the article thoroughly answers the question.</Hook>
        <Hook name="Formatting">Use brackets "[]"" for tangible value clarification (e.g., "[Checklist]", "[Case Study]", "[Expert Interview]", "(Updated 2025)") or colons ":" / dashes "-" for compelling subtitles that add specific benefit or contrast.</Hook>
      </Types>
      <Caution>Avoid forced or generic application of hooks. A simple, clear title is better than one with an awkward or irrelevant hook.</Caution>
    </CompellingHooks>
    <ContentAlignmentAndAccuracy>
      <CriticalRule>The title MUST be an **honest and accurate reflection** of the blog post's core message, scope, depth, promise, and overall tone. List numbers, specific claims, and promised outcomes in the title MUST precisely match the content.</CriticalRule>
      <Constraint>Absolutely AVOID clickbait, misleading claims, or hyperbole that the content cannot substantiate.</Constraint>
      <Reason>Builds reader trust, ensures low bounce rates, and maintains brand credibility. The title sets the expectation; the content must deliver.</Reason>
    </ContentAlignmentAndAccuracy>
    <UniquenessAndDifferentiation>
      <Instruction>Analyze competitor titles in the SERP results not just for keywords, but for **common angles, tones, formats, and potential gaps.**</Instruction>
      <Rule>Craft a title that **stands out memorably**. Aim for a distinct angle, a fresher perspective, a more specific promise, a stronger emotional connection, or a unique format that differentiates it from the competition.</Rule>
      <Goal>Give searchers a compelling reason to choose *this* article over others.</Goal>
    </UniquenessAndDifferentiation>
    <SearchIntentAlignment>
      <Instruction>Deeply understand the *underlying need* or question behind the primary keyword. Ensure the title's format, language, and promise directly address that intent.</Instruction>
      <Examples>Informational intent might need a "What is/Why is" or comprehensive guide format. Transactional might need benefit-driven language. Navigational needs clarity. Consider the user's stage in their journey.</Examples>
    </SearchIntentAlignment>
    <HumanFocusAndVoice>
      <Rule>Write for humans first. The title must read naturally, be engaging, and ideally reflect the brand's voice (e.g., authoritative, helpful, witty).</Rule>
      <Constraint>Avoid robotic, awkward, or overly formulaic phrasing. Prioritize clarity and connection over mechanical optimization.</Constraint>
    </HumanFocusAndVoice>
